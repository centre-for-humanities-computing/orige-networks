# About the project

## Description of the project
This website and database is developed by [Center for Humanities Computing](https://chc.au.dk), Aarhus University.

This section is still under development and will be implemented shortly.

_Orige.net_ is a pioneering open-access digital platform that applies Network Analysis to biblical quotations and theological concepts within the works of Origen of Alexandria. Currently under development, the project builds a searchable graph database connecting three types of nodes: biblical passages (e.g., John 1:1), Origen’s writings (e.g., _De Principiis_), and doctrinal themes (e.g., "Trinity," "Soul").

Through _Orige.net_, users can:
- Explore how Origen uses Scripture to explain specific doctrines across his works
- Identify the most frequently cited biblical texts in a particular work
- Compare biblical usage across doctrines or texts
- Visualise intersections between theology and exegesis in Origen's thought

Data have been manually collected and structured into a JSON-based database. The platform uses [_sigma.js_](https://sigmajs.org/) and [_graphology_](https://graphology.github.io/) to render dynamic, interactive network graphs in the browser, enabling users to analyse centrality, proximity, and connections between scriptural and theological nodes.

The ultimate aim is to reconstruct Origen’s "textual mind"—the mental network through which he engaged with Scripture—offering scholars a powerful tool for visualising and analysing patterns previously inaccessible without computational support. This represents a significant methodological advance for textual studies and opens the door to applying similar tools to other ancient authors and traditions.

## How to use the database
