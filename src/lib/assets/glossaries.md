## Definition of a quotation
Orige.net project aims to provide visual NA graphs of Origen’s use of biblical quotations in his works. A biblical quotation refers to a passage deliberately drawn from any of the biblical texts that Origen considered "canonical," regardless of the version or translation of the Bible he is using.  For the purposes of this project, the term “quotation” is understood as follows:

A quotation is a statement that maintains a degree of "otherness," indicating its origin in a text perceived as external to the author’s own work. As Gary Saul Morson defines it, "a quotation repeats the words of another _as_ the words of another" (Morson 2011, 78). In other words, a quotation is distinguished by its reproduction of an original source – the biblical texts – with the clear intention of presenting it as a reenactment. Thus, the defining criterion for determining when Origen is quoting a biblical text is **intentionality**. Regardless of the length of the quotation, any set of words spoken by Origen that is clearly intended to reference a specific biblical passage qualifies as a quotation. This also includes also the so-called "misquotations" – cases in which the biblical texts are misspelled – and the "indirect quotations" – cases where a passage is quoted indirectly, without using its exact wording, e.g. reference to the "prodigal son" without a specific reference to Luke 15:11-32. No distinction has been made between quotations and allusions. This implies that, for a passage to be recognised as a quotation, it must be identifiable as such. For example, not every mention of the doctrine of the "Logos" in Origen’s writings is a quotation of the prologue to John's Gospel. However, when Origen refers to the "Logos-in-the-beginning," he is clearly referring to John 1:1, because his language deliberately mirrors that of the biblical text. Although discerning an author's intent is not always possible, Origen’s philological precision in quoting the biblical text suggests that, in nearly all instances of his use of Scripture, his intentionality can be reasonably identified. In order to facilitate it, all the critical editions of Origen’s work (together with the SC volumes and several translations) have been consulted during the data collection to verify any discrepancies in the identification of biblical quotations.
